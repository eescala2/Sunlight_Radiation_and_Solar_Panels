# Target Solar Panel Market in Michigan 

![solar](Visuals/solar.png)

# Overview

Our team is interested in discovering our target market for residential solar panels in specific reginal Michigan cities. With solar panels being the cheapest form of clean and renewalable engery, we are looking to focus on areas with ideal solar radiation and a minimum base income to ensure that solar panels are cost effective for the customer.

The federal government currently offers a solar tax credit for homeowners who purchase solar panels for their primary, and occasionally secondary, homes. This tax credit allows you to claim a credit of 26% of the cost of your solar panels on your annual taxes. In 2023, the credit amount will be reduced to 22%, and the tax credit will disappear in 2024 unless extended.

The state of Michigan only has incentives in place for homeowners who wish to purchase solar panels. The state’s Michigan Saves Home Energy Loan Program allows you to upgrade your home’s energy efficiency with loans up to $30,000 and rates starting at 4.99%.
